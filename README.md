# Bookshelf Relations


> Auto insert, update and remove nested relationships.

## Installation

    npm install bookshelf-relations --save
    yarn add bookshelf-relations

## Usage

1. Register the plugin.

```
    bookshelf.plugin('bookshelf-relations');
```

2. Define your relationships on each model.

```
    bookshelf.Model.extend({
        relationships: ['tags', 'news']
    }, {...});
```

3. Ensure you call `initialize` of the parent model. This is only required if `autoHook` is set to true.

```
    const proto = bookshelf.Model.prototype;
    
    bookshelf.Model.extend({
        initialize: function() {
            // first register your model events. 
            // otherwise the order of events is different.
            
            // trigger parent
            proto.initialize.call(this);
        }
    });
```
    
## Plugin Options

- `autoHook`: The plugin hooks into your models via bookshelf model events. It adds/updates/deletes the passed relations. So it takes over everything for you. (**default: true**)
- `unsetRelations`: The plugin will unset the relations after they are detected. (**default: true**)
- `hooks.belongsToMany.beforeRelationCreation`: Hook into the process of updating belongsToMany relationships.
- `hooks.belongsToMany.after`: Hook into the process of updating belongsToMany relationships.

## Notes

### Events

If you are using `autoHook:true` (!), then you should know the following fact. 

Bookshelf triggers two events if you insert data: `created` and `saved` (in this order).
Bookshelf triggers two events if you update data: `updated` and `saved` (in this order).

`autoHook:true` makes use of the `created` and `updated` events.

If you are also listen on `created`, please ensure you don't rely on the data, because your parent model will for sure receive the event first.
And that means, the relations were not yet updated. This is not optimal, but hard to solve right now.

So, please use the `saved` event and differentiate between `options.method=insert|update` - this is reliable.

You don't have to use the builtin `autoHook`, you can simply trigger the plugin yourself using `bookshelf.manager.updateRelations`.

### Transactions

*It's highly recommended to insert/update/delete your models within [transactions](http://bookshelfjs.org/#Bookshelf-instance-transaction) when using this plugin, because updating nested relationships requires additional queries to the database. Otherwise if an error occurs during any query, you can't expect data to be rolled back fully.*


## Unsupported

~~The plugin is not able to update nested-nested relations at the moment. e.g. `.set('tags', [{ name: 'tag1', [relation]: {} }])`. Relation won't get updated.~~ Supported, but no tests available.
